# Mancala

This summer I discovered Mancala for the first time while lounging about in the June warmth. It's rather easy to quickly learn the game which led me to think that it's likely pretty solvable by a computer. A player can only make 5 possible moves, which is small when compared to the complexities in chess, for example.  
So, this is my attempt to implement a little interactive Mancala game with (hopefully) a rather strong AI opponent. I hope through further research and development I discover more about the game and end up producing a program that combines some interesting insight and some of my skills learned at University.
